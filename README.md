this is a simple game simulation. My very first big program, before i knew what functions were, <br/>
and how to partition a code into different files<br/>
The structure of the code is well developed for strictly using the if/then conditional with limited to no switch cases<br/>
This program is a mess and a half but honestly this program was one of the reasons i love coding,<br/>
because even though i hadnt learned any style or shortcuts, i was able to create what i was thinking for a game simulation into<br/>
an actual program
